                            <p> Hey there honorary Justice League members - it‚Äôs a new week which means it‚Äôs time for a new discussion thread! For those who don't know: the way this works is that several comments will list this week‚Äôs releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, Green Lantern discussion would go in the replies to the "Green Lantern" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too. In other words, you should only be reply. Before getting into this week's results, I want to join countless others in marking the passing of the incomparable Stan Lee. His work and his legacy are an undeniable part of why I am at my local comic shop every Wednesday and why I'm back here to talk comics with this community each week. Thank you and rest easy, Stan. -ptb The Weekly Pull List results () for this Wednesday are in, and this week's top book is DC's MISTER MIRACLE #12 . This thread is open to Pull List posters 
Welcome to the Weekly Pull List for Wednesday November 21st, 2018.

Below are links to shipping lists where you can see everything that will be on the shelf this week: Comic List ( League of Comic. #Respect Brainiac ####"No, Superman. You did. So small and weak a figure, and yet, you are the embodiment of a constant threat. You evaded even my most promising experiment." Bio: On planet Yod-Colu, a scientist named Vril Dox developed an advanced artificial intelligence named C.O.M.P.U.T.O. Using it, he was able to peer into the fifth dimension. However, he discovered the destruction of his world and many others by a force called ‚ÄúThe Multitude". His attempts to stop this future. 1. Callie and Arizona from Grey's Anatomy 2.

Mickey Milkovich from Shameless 12. Kelsey Peters from Younger 13. Phoebe. Hi, I just got back into Supergirl after a long time of not being able to Read her and was wondering if anyone could help me establish a reading order for stories she is involved in from #0 of New 52 onward. What I know so far: Books I own are in bold, lemme know books I still need to buy and I'll add them to the list, lemme know anything I need to move around and I'll do so. :P --------------- New 52!: Supergirl #0 New 52!: Supergirl #1 New 52!: Supergirl #2 New 52!: Superg. Hey there honorary Justice League Members, another week, and another discussion thread, which means it's time to talk! Sorry I'm late this week, I've been super busy and to be honest, it kind of slipped my mind. For those who don't know, the way this works is that several comments will list this weeks releases, for any given title discussion you'd respond to that comment. For example, Green Lantern discussion would go in the replies to the "Green Lantern" comment. That means that unless. ''' Yes you are so right. Now please go back to watching supergirl.

I've read the classics but i was always to intimidated by DC's bigger numbers.New 52 is when i upgraded to serious reserve list status, but I've dropped many. One resolution I made was to TRY to find an enjoyable superman story, i love superman, i wnat to prove all my batfag friends wrong. Recently I've been trimming my collection, probably going to end up ditching them on kids in charity or goodwill. I took all my favorite issues and mixed them all up interlocking with each other New Codes (.00) Avengers: 677  Recent Codes - .00 Spectacular Spider-man: 299 Champions: 16 Gwenpool: 24 Moon Girl: 26 Venom Inc.

üò¢. Just looking to offload a few of the comics I have laying around. They haven't been bagged and boarded (minus 2 copies of Justice League that I received doubles of and a copy of Supergirl). They have slight wear from reading. I would like: ~~The Amazing Spider-Man- ~~ ~~Justice League- ~~ ~~Supergirl- ~~ These prices are all shipped. http://imgur.com/a/yJJNx. </p>
