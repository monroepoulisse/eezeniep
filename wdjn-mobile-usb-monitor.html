                            <p> I guess i mean like an empty laptop, no components besides a keyboard and a high def screen, that connects to a desktop pc? That way you can get the mobility of the laptop with the power of a pc desktop. I just dont feel comfortable sitting in a chair Seems most of the mobile monitors use USB interface to connect. If someone has tried them I',m wondering if they work well on linux. 
Looking to upgrade to three monitors and a better laptop. I'm a little stubborn and don't like USB C docks. Still rocking an older docking station a really old Elitebook. Would anyone be able to recommend something that fits the above. HDMI and USB 3.0/3.1 Like the title says, i want to watch 4K movies on my 4K TV. Im new to this so bear with me. Ive tried Plex, but im not sure on how to get it to Direct Play, since its always Transcoding (maybe cuz the file is an mkv ?). If its because of that, is there any way to get Plex to Direct Play it ? (for reference, im trying to watch a remux of Deadpool 2, 2160p HDR). Also, it tends to buffer a lot. If Plex isnt the solution , are there any other video players for TV that support Hey everyone, I just received my brand-new Asus MB16AP, and I figured I'd try and answer any questions that you all might have. A little about my setup: Surface Pro 4 and an HP Workstation Surface Dock 2 DELL U2414H Monitors connected via Mini-Display port I've been a long time lurker of this sub, and have gotten lots of useful information so I just want to give back to the community if I can. :) Disclaimer: I am not a Tech blogger so this QampA format would probably be much more useful. Originally promised in April, the Acer Nitro 5 was announced as officially released in the US on AMD's Facebook feed on June 30th.

Looking to get a retropie setup. Would prefer something that can be mobile since I fly a lot. Seen things advertised on amazon and Facebook but whenever I start asking questions I get silence which does not inspire confidence in a product. Can anyone here recommend anything. Hi friends! My organization runs a community health program where our county EMTs do home visits with high utilizers of 911 and EMS. We use Zoll X-Series monitors on the visits to establish a baseline for the pt, and then upload the data to ImageTrend (for better or worse, these are the systems we have). Since I'm not really aware of any subreddits for Zoll products or community health, I've concluded that you all may be the best when it comes to getting some insights. I've read through Welcome to the bi-weekly post for folks to request gear recommendations. Low-cost gear and purchasing recommendation requests have become common in the AE subreddit. There is also great repetition of models asked about and advised for use. This weekly post is intended to assist in centralizing and answering requests and recommendations. Daily Threads: Monday - Gear Recommendations (http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/search?q=title%3Arecommendation+author%3Aautomoderatoramprestri. Hey all, I've been moving my recording area around (with moving and all). I used to use my desktop to record, but now that I've moved to my closet I needed to use something a little more.mobile. I tried using my laptop but unfortunately it's seen better days and the fans are incrediblyyy loud now (should probably retire it from use). Ideally I'd like to grab a tablet for the mobility and lack of fan/fan noise. Unfortunately I'm having difficulty finding one as I'm not too savvy in the tablet. Hi guys, I am not an expert, but I was wondering since Polaris cards have low power consuption they're gonne probably fit in laptops, if not, certainly special mobile versions will (which are gonna be pretty similar performance-wise I guess). Knowing that, and also the continous progress with less power hungry CPU's, what reason should keep us for still buying desktops. 
I know this isn't a subreddit for this, but I figured you could help. If this isn't allowed, I'll delete it. Sorry mods! Use - DotA2 on high settings. State your budget (in your country's currency): 0-1,100. Intel 7 if possible, wifi ready. Just running DotA2 on high settings. Something that will not blow up on me. I would love for the computer to come from this place: www.frys.com Preferably something I can pick up at the store. Thank. i am looking to upgrade my laptop from an ancient thinkpad t60 to either a lenovo n586 or a dell e4310. there is a 60 dollar difference between the two on the local used market. i don't really have a whole lot more than 200ish to spend on something used. hence, my expectations are not super high. i have a mini and microbrute, a beatstep and i also mix in some recordings of my acoustic instruments. i have the required audio interface and studio monitors, just looking for some guidance on whethe. So I've seen lots of posts and links that say the best way to use a mini monitor with a mobile pi is to get something like this: I was wondering how you would power such a monitor and the pi at the same time while </p>
